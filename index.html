 <h2>Last news </h2>
 
 <p>Assassin's Creed Valhalla is getting another helping of free post-launch content - including a "highly replayable" new River Raids mode - as part of its latest title update, arriving tomorrow, 16th February on all platforms.

Ubisoft hasn't shared much in the way of specifics regarding River Raids mode just yet, but says it'll take adventurers to unexplored regions of the UK, spread across three new maps. Before embarking on raids, however, players are encouraged to construct the new Jomsviking Hall settlement building in order to recruit more Jomsvikings to bring along for support, with new loot, rewards, and challenges promised along the way.

Valhalla's latest title update, which is considered to be part of the game's first season of post-launch content, also introduces a number of new abilities and skills.</p>
